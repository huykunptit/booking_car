# Carento Editorial Premium Design System

## 1. Mission

Create a premium, cinematic, editorial-inspired design system for Carento that transforms the vehicle rental experience into a refined mobility booking product.

Carento must feel like:

* a premium car rental marketplace,
* a modern mobility booking platform,
* an editorial vehicle showcase,
* a trustworthy consumer booking experience.

Carento must not feel like:

* an enterprise dashboard,
* a generic marketplace clone,
* a classified car listing site,
* a flat utility booking form.

This design system is inspired by the discipline, restraint, contrast, and editorial composition of luxury automotive websites, but it is fully reskinned for Carento’s rental-booking domain.

---

## 2. Brand Personality

Carento visual identity keywords:

* premium
* cinematic
* trustworthy
* spacious
* editorial
* modern mobility
* conversion-focused
* calm luxury

The UI must create a feeling of confidence before conversion.

Every page should make users feel:

* the service is reliable,
* the vehicles are high-quality,
* the booking flow is simple,
* the brand is modern and premium,
* the experience is curated rather than crowded.

---

## 3. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

Carento uses an editorial automotive rhythm:

* dark cinematic hero sections,
* clean light booking panels,
* premium vehicle imagery,
* strong typography hierarchy,
* restrained accent colors,
* spacious section pacing.

The visual rhythm should alternate between:

1. **Cinematic dark moments** for hero, premium vehicle showcase, brand storytelling.
2. **Clean light panels** for booking, forms, filters, details, pricing, and trust information.

This creates a luxury automotive browsing experience without sacrificing booking clarity.

## 4. Color System

Carento reuses the Ferrari-inspired color palette directly, but remaps its meaning for a premium car rental marketplace.

The palette must feel:

* cinematic,
* high-contrast,
* editorial,
* restrained,
* premium automotive.

### 4.6 Color Usage Rules

Ferrari Red is now Carento's strongest conversion signal.

* high-priority conversion moments,
* brand-critical highlights.

Black and white create the main editorial rhythm.

* `space.2=8px`
* `space.3=12px`

### 6.2 Spacing Philosophy

Carento uses spacing as a premium signal.

Priority:

1. whitespace,
2. alignment,
3. grouping,
4. elevation,
5. borders.

Layouts must never feel compressed.
Booking forms should be grouped into digestible sections.
Vehicle listings should be scannable without feeling crowded.

---

## 7. Radius System

* `radius.md=12px`
* `radius.lg=16px`
* `radius.xl=24px`

### Radius Rules

Carento should feel softer and more consumer-friendly than Ferrari-inspired razor-sharp luxury.

Use:

* medium radius for cards,
* large radius for hero booking panels,
* pill radius for badges and chips,
* soft radius for input fields and buttons.

Do not use harsh square boxes for consumer pages.

* `shadow.cinematic=0 24px 80px rgba(2,6,23,0.28)`

### 8.2 Elevation Rules

Use shadow softly.
Depth should come from:

* surface layering,
* spacing,
* gentle elevation.

Do not add heavy shadows to every card.
Do not make UI look like floating admin boxes.

* `motion.duration.normal=320ms`
* `motion.duration.slow=480ms`
* `motion.easing=cubic-bezier(0.4,0,0.2,1)`

Motion must feel:

* subtle,
* smooth,
* premium,
* responsive.

Use motion for:

* hover lift,

* modal entrance,
* filter panel transitions,
* card refinement.

Avoid playful bounce, excessive parallax, or distracting animation.
